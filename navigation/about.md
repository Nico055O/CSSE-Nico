  I am 18 years old and I attend Del Norte High School. Some hobbies of mine include fishing and collecting hot wheels. I actually like collecting things in general, as I had once had a rock collection, lego minecraft set collection, and fidget spinner collection. But currently I avidly collect hot wheels at pretty much every store that sells them, as well as my Jordan shoes collection that I wear regularly as I do not plan to resell any of my shoes. I have a dog that I really love because he is very play full and soft to pet. I love to fish everywhere as I have an expensive collection of fishing rods, reels, and lures. I like to play a lot of video games too, as I play on my PS4 way too much. My favorite video games currently are GTA 5, Call of Duty Warzone, Overwatch, and Roblox from time to time. I also like to hangout with my friends wether it's on the video games we play together or outside doing random stuff with eachother. But either way we always try to find a way to hang out with eachother.

  I also really like cars, as I consider myself a car enthusiast. I like to make car edits as well as take photos of cars. I want to be an Automotive Engineer and I plan and already been accepted to ASU to go to school for my dream career. I know a lot about cars as I like learning new things especially in the automotive space.
